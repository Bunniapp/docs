# IBunniHub

BunniHub is the main contract Liquidity Providers (LPs) interact with. Deploys pools and handles depositing and withdrawing from those pools. Source code for IBunniHub can be found [here](https://github.com/timeless-fi/bunni-hooks/blob/main/src/interfaces/IBunniHub.sol).

## Functions

### deployBunniToken

```solidity
function deployBunniToken(
  DeployBunniTokenParams calldata params
) external returns (IBunniToken token, PoolKey memory key)
```

Deploys the BunniToken contract for a Bunni position. This token represents a user's share in the Uniswap V4 LP position.

#### Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `params` | struct DeployBunniTokenParams | The parameters necessary to deploy the BunniToken, encoded as DeployBunniTokenParams in calldata. |

#### Return Values:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `token` | IBunniToken | The deployed BunniToken. |
| `key` | PoolKey | The PoolKey of the Uniswap V4 pool. |

### deposit

```solidity
function deposit(
  DepositParams calldata params
) external payable returns (uint256 shares, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
```

Increases the amount of liquidity in a position, with tokens paid by the `msg.sender`, Must be called after the corresponding BunniToken has been deployed via `deployBunniToken()`.

#### Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `params` | struct DepositParams | The parameters necessary for the deposit, encoded as DepositParams in calldata. |

#### Return Values:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `shares` | uint256 | The new share tokens minted to the sender. |
| `amount0` | uint256 | The amount of token0 to acheive resulting liquidity. |
| `amount1` | uint256 | The amount of token1 to acheive resulting liquidity. |

### withdraw

```solidity
function withdraw(
  WithdrawParams calldata params
) external returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
```

Decreases the amount of liquidity in the position and sends the tokens to the sender. If withdrawing ETH, need to follow up with `unwrapWETH9()` and `sweepToken()`. Must be called after the corresponding BunniToken has been deployed via `deployBunniToken()`.

#### Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `params` | struct WithdrawParams | The parameters necessary for the withdraw, encoded as WithdrawParams in calldata. |

#### Return Values:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `amount0` | uint256 | The amount of token0 withdrawn to the recipient. |
| `amount1` | uint256 | The amount of token1 withdrawn to the recipient. |

### queueWithdraw

```solidity
function queueWithdraw(
  QueueWithdrawParams calldata params
) external
```

Queues a withdrawal of liquidity. Need to use this before calling withdraw() if am-AMM is enabled and a manager exists for the pool. A queued withdrawal is unlocked after WITHDRAW_DELAY (1 minutes) has passed, and before WITHDRAW_GRACE_PERIOD (15 minutes) has passed after it's been unlocked. This ensures the am-AMM manager has an opportunity to execute any arbitrage trades before a withdrawal is processed.

#### Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `params` | struct QueueWithdrawParams | The parameters necessary for the queue withdraw, encoded as QueueWithdrawParams in calldata. |

### hookHandleSwap

```solidity
hookHandleSwap(
  PoolKey calldata key,
  bool zeroForOne,
  uint256 inputAmount,
  uint256 outputAmount
) external
```

Called by the hook to execute a generalized swap from one token to the other. Also used during rebalancing. If the raw balance is insufficient, vault reserves will be automatically used. Will update vault reserves if the raw/reserve ratio is outside of the bounds.

#### Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| `key` | struct PoolKey | The PoolKey of the Uniswap V4 pool. |
| `zeroForOne` | bool | True if the swap is for token0->token1, false if token1->token0. |
| `inputAmount` | uint256 | The amount of the input token to pull from the hook. |
| `outputAmount` | uint256 | The amount of the output token to push to the hook. |

poolState(
  PoolId poolId
) external view returns (PoolState memory)
```

### poolParams

```solidity
function poolParams(
  PoolId poolId
) external view returns (PoolState memory)
```

### poolBalances

```solidity
function poolBalances(
  PoolId poolId
) external view returns (uint256 balance0, uint256 balance1)
```

The token balances of a Bunni pool. Reserves in vaults are converted to raw token balances via `ERC4626.previewRedeem()`.
