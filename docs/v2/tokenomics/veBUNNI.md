`veBUNNI` is the governance token of the Bunni protocol.

`veBUNNI` (vote-escrow BUNNI) is a vesting system based on [Curve's veCRV mechanism](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html) which locks BUNNI tokens for a maximum of 1 year.

By locking BUNNI, holders are given veBUNNI, entitling them to governance rights and protocol fee collection. A user's veBUNNI balance is directly proportional to the amount of BUNNI locked and the duration of time left in the lock period. If a user locked 1 BUNNI for 52 weeks, they will receive the amount of "vote escrowed" strength as someone who locks 2 BUNNI for 26 weeks.


### Protocol Fee Distribution

Following the approval of TIP-009, Bunni v2 has an initial protocol rake set to 10% of swap fees. veBUNNI holders will be entitled to collect a portion of the protocol rake as defined by the following graduated distribution schedule. Both the protocol rake as well as the distribution are subject to change at the discretion of governance.
