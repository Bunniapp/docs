Users can claim their airdrop on Ethereum Mainnet via the claim interface on the Bunni app ([https://bunni.xyz/airdrop](https://bunni.xyz/airdrop?chain=mainnet)).

Following the approval of TIP-009, a [veBUNNI](https://etherscan.io/token/0x00000042877f4a1cC0693383ebdAc7c0e0A1bf77) airdrop was approved for various stakeholders within the Bunni ecosystem. All airdrops are in the form of `veBUNNI`, which is `BUNNI` locked for 1 year. For more information on veBUNNI and it's mechanics, please refer to the `veBUNNI` [documentation](./veBUNNI).

Snapshot Block: [21121993](https://etherscan.io/block/21121993)



### veLIT Holders

A total of `144,288,556 veBUNNI` was allocated to `veLIT` holders.

Following the approval of TIP-009, `veLIT` holders relinquished governance control to `veBUNNI`. This airdrop allocation gives `veLIT` holders a share of `veBUNNI` vote power proportional to their share of `veLIT` at the snapshot block. Once users' `veLIT` locks have expired, they are encouraged to withdraw their lock and migrate their `LIT` to `BUNNI`, which can be done at a 1:1 ratio indefinitely. `BUNNI` can then be locked for `veBUNNI` if desired.

Holders of `liqLIT` were included directly in the `veLIT` allocation. All `liqLIT` holders should ensure that the Liquis multisig has defined a plan to withdraw their `veLIT` lock once expired and distribute the resulting BPT directly to liqLIT holders.

### LIQ Holders

A total of `10,000,000 veBUNNI` was allocated to `LIQ` holders.

Liquis was an integral part of the Bunni v1 ecosystem and this airdrop allocation aims to encourage `LIQ` holders to migrate to the Bunni ecosystem.

### Testnet Users

A total of `5,085,500 veBUNNI` was allocated to testnet participants.

Users of the Bunni v2 testnet, specifically those who completed quests, are eligible for a `veBUNNI` airdrop. Eligibility criteria was based on the number of completed quests prior to the snapshot block and awards power users more significantly than other users. 

| Quests Completed | Airdrop (per quest) |
| ----- | ----- |
| 11 Quests | 600 veBUNNI per quest |
| 8-10 Quests | 200 veBUNNI per quest |
| 5-7 Quests | 100 veBUNNI per quest |
| 1-4 Quests | None |
