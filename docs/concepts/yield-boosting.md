# Yield Boosting

Yield boosting refers to the strategy where instead of depositing your funds into a farm (e.g. Yearn USDC vault), you use your funds to purchase the corresponding [PYT](concepts/pyt) on the market (e.g. Yearn USDC vault PYT).

## Pros

- Because PYT trades at a price lower than the underlying asset (see [this post](https://blog.timelessfi.com/posts/pyt-pricing/#observations)), using the yield boosting strategy can give you a 1-2x multiplier on the yield you earn.
- If the yield rate goes up, your portfolio goes up.

## Cons

- If the yield rate goes down, your portfolio goes down. This is the main risk of yield boosting.
