# Perpetual Yield Token (PYT)

## Intro

Timeless **perpetual yield tokens (PYT)** represent streams of future yield generated by the corresponding principal. 1 PYT always corresponds to 1 underlying principal, which makes accounting easier.

For example, say we have a PYT that uses the Yearn USDC vault to generate yield, then 1 PYT represents the right to claim the yield generated by 1 USDC in the Yearn USDC vault from now to forever in the future.

PYTs are useful because their prices move in the same direction as the yield rates of the yield-generating vaults they use, so itâ€™s easy to use them to [speculate on yield rates](./yield-speculation). They're also useful for [yield boosting](./yield-boosting), where you buy PYT off the market at a discount to boost the yield you earn.

## Pricing PYT

Please read [this post](https://blog.timelessfi.com/posts/pyt-pricing/) to learn more about how to price PYT based on the yield rate.
